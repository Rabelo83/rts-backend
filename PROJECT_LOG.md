# RTS Project Log

Purpose: Keep a short history of meaningful project changes (features, fixes, deployments, blockers, decisions).

How to use:
- Update `TASKS.md` and `data/project_tasks.json` for current status changes.
- Add a log entry here for major changes only.
- Keep entries short and dated.

### 2026-02-24
- Type: `feature`, `docs`
- Summary: Added project task tracking system and dashboard page for status visibility.
- Files/Areas: `TASKS.md`, `data/project_tasks.json`, `routes/project_status.py`, `public_html/dashboard.html`, `app.py`
- Notes / Follow-up: Keep `TASKS.md` and `data/project_tasks.json` updated after each completed/pending/blocked status change. Dashboard is currently public at `/dashboard` once deployed.

### 2026-02-24
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Added manual task creation from dashboard via `POST /api/project/tasks`.
- Files/Areas: `routes/project_status.py`, `public_html/dashboard.html`
- Notes / Follow-up: Followed by SQLite-backed storage for manual dashboard tasks. Set `PROJECT_TASKS_DB_PATH` to a persistent disk path on Render for redeploy-safe storage.

### 2026-02-24
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Switched manual dashboard task storage from JSON file writes to SQLite and merged manual tasks into dashboard API output.
- Files/Areas: `routes/project_status.py`, `public_html/dashboard.html`
- Notes / Follow-up: Default DB path is `data/project_tasks.sqlite`; override with `PROJECT_TASKS_DB_PATH` (recommended for Render persistent disk mount path).

### 2026-02-24
- Type: `decision`
- Summary: Reverted dashboard manual task entry and returned `/dashboard` to read-only task viewing.
- Files/Areas: `routes/project_status.py`, `public_html/dashboard.html`
- Notes / Follow-up: Continue updating `TASKS.md` and `data/project_tasks.json` manually as the project task source of truth.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Built tool-use agent v2 (GPT-4o-mini) — LLM now calls tools instead of acting as a chat model. Wired into Flask as `/api/agent/v2` and `/api/agent/v2/stream`.
- Files/Areas: `routes/agent_v2.py`, `routes/agent_tools.py`, `routes/agent_api.py`, `public_html/chat_v2.js`
- Notes / Follow-up: Chat UI switches to v2 via `?agent=v2` URL param. Old `/api/agent` untouched.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Built GPT-driven scenario testing infrastructure: 30 scenarios, test runner, analysis prompt, user simulator prompt.
- Files/Areas: `tests/scenarios_v2.json`, `tests/run_v2_scenarios.py`, `tests/gpt_analysis_prompt.md`, `tests/gpt_user_simulator_prompt.md`, `tests/codex_run_and_analyze.md`
- Notes / Follow-up: Run with `python tests/run_v2_scenarios.py` (prod) or `--env local` (Flask test client). Last run: 23/30 pass.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `fix`
- Summary: Fixed wrong-day schedule bug — Render server (UTC) returned Saturday schedule after 7 PM Eastern because `date.today()` crossed midnight UTC.
- Files/Areas: `routes/schedule_service.py` (3 call sites)
- Notes / Follow-up: Replaced `date.today()` with `datetime.now(TZ).date()` using existing `TZ = ZoneInfo("America/New_York")`.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Added customer service hours to all no-data / escalation messages (Mon–Fri 8 AM–5 PM / lun–vie 8 AM–5 PM).
- Files/Areas: `routes/agent_v2.py`, `routes/agent_api.py`
- Notes / Follow-up: Affects English and Spanish escalation paths.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `feature`
- Summary: Added Quick Links panel to dashboard sidebar and expanded README with full live-site URLs and API endpoint table.
- Files/Areas: `public_html/dashboard.html`, `README.md`
- Notes / Follow-up: v2 agent test URL (`/chat?agent=v2`) highlighted in purple in dashboard.

### 2026-02-27
- Type: `docs`
- Summary: Documented Codex sandbox limitations — no network, no pip, no socket binding. Updated `codex_run_and_analyze.md` to use Flask test client (`--env local`) which avoids socket binding. Codex analyzes pre-existing results when pip packages unavailable.
- Files/Areas: `tests/codex_run_and_analyze.md`
- Notes / Follow-up: If Codex CLI installed locally, full test+fix loop works. In web sandbox, only file read/write/git is reliable.
